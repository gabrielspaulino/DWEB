    <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
    <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags,</br> incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
    support, and abandoned browsers.</p>

    <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the</br> tireless efforts of folk like
    the W3C, WaSP, and the major browser creators.</p>

    <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the</br> masters. Begin to see with
    clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques
    in new</br> and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

    <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
    <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite,</br> inspire, and encourage
    participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in</br>
    the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The HTML</br> remains the same, the only
    thing that has changed is the external CSS file. Yes, really.</p>

    <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The</br> only way this can be illustrated
    in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating</br>
    what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create</br> beauty from structure.
    Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of</br> the web; we can always push it further.</p>

    <h3>Participation</h3>
    <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so</br> strong CSS skills are necessary too,
    but the example files are commented well enough</br> that
    even CSS novices can use them as starting points.</p>

    <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem</br> daunting at first if you’ve
    never worked this way before, but follow the listed links</br> to learn more,
    and use the sample files as a guide.</p>

    <p>Download the sample HTML and CSS to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed</br> your masterpiece (and please,
    don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to</br> a web server
    under your control. Send us a link to an archive of that file and all</br> associated assets, and if we choose to use it
    we will download it and place it on our</br> server.</p>

    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to</br> showing people how amazing CSS
    really can be. This site serves as equal parts</br> inspiration for those
    working on the web today, learning tool for those who will be</br> tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all
    look forward to.</p>
